### **Phase 6.6: Deployment Architecture & Code Organization** (COMPLETED)

#### **Problem Identified: Type Duplication & Deployment Complexity**
**Issue**: Frontend imports types from backend, creating deployment issues:
- Frontend references `src/types/api.ts` 
- Backend has duplicate interfaces in `server/services/aiToolsService.ts`
- Type drift already occurring (`unknown` vs `JsonValue`)
- Deployment targets require entire codebase but build different portions

#### **Research & Decision Process**
**Perplexity Research Findings**:
- ✅ **Monorepo with shared types**: Best for type safety and maintainability
- ❌ **Separate repos + shared package**: Too complex for our timeline
- ❌ **Type duplication**: High risk of drift (already happening)
- ⚠️ **Bolt.new Constraints**: No workspace support, prefers simple flat structures

#### **✅ Solution Implemented: Hybrid Shared Types Strategy**

**Architecture Decision**: 
```
webrtc-converse/                    # ✅ Bolt.new compatible flat structure
├── shared/                         # 🆕 Single source of truth for types
│   └── types.ts                    # All shared interfaces
├── src/                            # Frontend (imports from ../shared/types)
├── server/                         # Backend (imports from ../shared/types)  
├── package.json                    # Root dependencies (both frontend + backend)
├── netlify.toml                    # 🆕 Frontend-only build config
└── server-deploy.config            # 🆕 Backend-only build config
```

**Deployment Strategy**:
- **Frontend (Netlify)**: Deploy entire codebase → Build only `src/` → Serve `dist/`
- **Backend (VPS/Railway)**: Deploy entire codebase → Build only `server/` → Run `server/dist/`
- **Shared Types**: Both import from `shared/types.ts` - no duplication
- **Bolt.new Compatible**: Simple structure, no workspaces, maintains demo capabilities

#### **Benefits Achieved**:
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Single source of truth eliminates drift
- ✅ **Bolt.new Compatible**: Simple flat structure preserved  
- ✅ **Clean Deployment**: Each target builds only relevant code
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Proper separation for scaling
- ✅ **Future Proof**: Easy migration to monorepo when needed

#### **Implementation Completed**:
- ✅ **HTTP + TanStack Query Architecture**: Proper frontend/backend separation
- ✅ **Environment Variables Fixed**: Backend server now starts successfully  
- ✅ **Type System Cleanup**: All lint errors resolved
- ✅ **Authentication Flow**: Meeting creation working with proper auth
- ✅ **Service Layer Migration**: All frontend services moved to HTTP API calls

### **Phase 8: Hackathon Execution (May 30 - June 30)**

## 🚀 **Phase 6.1-6.4: Critical Integration & Testing** (CURRENT PHASE)

### **🔥 URGENT: ElevenLabs Tool Integration (Phase 6.1)**
**Issue Discovered**: AI tools are defined but NOT registered with ElevenLabs agent
**Status**: Tool integration commented out in useElevenLabsVoiceRAG.ts (lines 200-202)
**Impact**: Conversational AI cannot access meeting knowledge - core feature broken
**ETA**: 2-3 days to implement and test

#### **Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **Research @elevenlabs/react tool registration API** (exact syntax unknown)
2. **Implement tool registration** in conversation.startSession()
3. **Add tool execution callbacks** for client-side tool handling
4. **Test end-to-end**: voice → AI → tool call → knowledge search → response

### **📊 Knowledge Base Testing (Phase 6.2)**
**Status**: RAG system built but lacks comprehensive testing
**Risk**: Unknown reliability of core knowledge functionality
**Required**: Unit tests, integration tests, performance validation
**ETA**: 2-3 days

### **👥 User Experience Flow Validation (Phase 6.3)**  
**Status**: Authentication works but invitation/onboarding flows untested
**Risk**: Poor UX for hackathon demo scenarios
**Required**: End-to-end user journey testing
**ETA**: 2-3 days

### **🎤 Conversational AI Validation (Phase 6.4)**
**Status**: Voice works but AI+knowledge integration unverified  
**Risk**: Core value proposition may not function in practice
**Required**: Complete system integration testing
**ETA**: 1-2 days

---

## 🚀 **Phase 6.5: Production Deployment & Invite Token System**

### **Deployment Architecture (Research Complete)**

#### **Hybrid Deployment Strategy**
**Frontend (Netlify):**
- React app with Vite build pipeline
- Environment variables for production APIs
- Optimized static hosting with CDN

**Backend (Render/Railway/Heroku):**
- Node.js + Express + Socket.io server
- WebRTC signaling support (requires persistent connections)
- Database migrations and API endpoints
- **Why not Netlify**: Netlify Functions don't support persistent WebSocket connections needed for Socket.io

#### **Invite Token System Architecture**
```sql
-- Database Schema Addition
CREATE TABLE invite_tokens (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  token varchar(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email varchar(255),
  role varchar(50) DEFAULT 'judge',
  created_by varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  used_at timestamptz NULL,
  used_by_user_id varchar(255) NULL,
  expires_at timestamptz NOT NULL,
  is_active boolean DEFAULT true
);
```

#### **Authentication & Meeting Flow Design**
```
Hackathon Judge Access Flow:
1. Judge receives invite token via email
2. Judge visits signup page with token
3. Token validated → Clerk.dev signup allowed
4. Judge authenticated → can create meetings
5. Judge creates meeting → gets meeting ID
6. Judge shares meeting ID with participants
7. Participants join with meeting ID (no auth required)

Meeting Creation Flow:
- ✅ Meeting creation requires authentication
- ✅ Meeting host must be authenticated user
- ✅ Participants can join with meeting ID only
- ✅ Project-based meetings require project membership
```

#### **API Endpoints for Invite System**
```javascript
// Admin endpoints (require auth)
POST /api/secure/invite-tokens      // Generate tokens
GET /api/secure/invite-tokens       // List tokens
PUT /api/secure/invite-tokens/:id   // Deactivate token

// Public endpoints (for signup flow)
POST /api/invite-tokens/validate    // Check token validity
POST /api/invite-tokens/consume     // Mark token as used
```

#### **Clerk.dev Integration Strategy**
- Custom signup flow with token validation
- Pre-signup hook to verify invite token
- Token consumption after successful signup
- Maintain existing authentication for meetings
